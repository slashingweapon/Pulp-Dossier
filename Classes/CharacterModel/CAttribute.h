	is returned.
 
	For example, string attributes never return a controller because they can be edited within
	the cell.  Ladder attributes have a view for editing (changing the ladder value), but no 
	view for detail display.  Tracks have both a detail and an editing display, becuase all
	of the information for a track won't ever fit inside a cell (unless we make cells a lot
	bigger).
