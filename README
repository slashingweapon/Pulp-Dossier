Pulp Dossier is a character sheet for role-playing games based on Spirit of the
Century source material.  It is not intended to enforce rules, but just keep 
track of your character information and give you an easy way to track status
information.

I'm not doing this for money.  I am doing this because my gaming group is 
planning on having a SotC game this summer and I thought it would be fun to
program.

My goals for version 1.0 are to support the following:

	- Basic character information
		- Picture and general information
		- Background
		- Aspects
		- Skills
		- Stunts
		- Gagets
	- Sample characters
	- Built-in text for the SotC source material
		- Sample characters
		- Sample aspects
		- Skills
		- Stunts
		- Gagets
	- Status information
		- fate points
		- health
		- composure
		- consequences
	- A 4dF die roller
		- shake the iphone to roll dice!
	- User-selected images for the character dossier and gagets
	- Print characters to dead-tree format

I have a lot of ideas for future versions, depending on user requests and what
I happen to be interested in.  In no particular order:

	- A virtual "Table Top" that enables multiplay interations
		- start/join/leave a Table
		- group chat
		- private chat with GM/players
		- collective character generation
	- UI themes for characters
	- The addition of more skills/etc via "Source Books".
	- Support for different Fate/Fudge related characters
	- Support for adjusting quality/prices of goods by time period
